## Recommended External Electives  

This is a link to a spreadsheet where students can share their experiences with electives taken outside our faculty.  

It provides an opportunity for new students to explore courses beyond the scope of our program and find interesting electives!  

The spreadsheet includes:  
- **Faculty**  
- **Course code**  
- **Course name**  
- **Study guide link**  
- **Credits**  
- **Quarter**  
- **Experienced difficulty level**  
- **Why is this course relevant?**  
- **Optional: contact person** (so interested students can ask for more details)
